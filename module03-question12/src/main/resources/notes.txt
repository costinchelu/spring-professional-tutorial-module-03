TransactionIsolation.SERIALIZABLE

    The first read operation hangs for the timeout of 10 sec (set by the countDownLatch) because SERIALIZABLE is using read-write locks.
    The read operation locks all the records so the write operation will wait for the read operation to finish.
    Then the 4th read will wait for the writing operation and on this final read we will see the written data.

    > First Read Operation
    Employee(id=1...
    Employee(id=2...
    Employee(id=3...
    Employee(id=5...
    Employee(id=6...
    > Second Read Operation
    Employee(id=1...
    Employee(id=2...
    Employee(id=3...
    Employee(id=5...
    Employee(id=6...
    > Third Read Operation
    Employee(id=1...
    Employee(id=2...
    Employee(id=3...
    Employee(id=5...
    Employee(id=6...
    >> Finishing Reading
